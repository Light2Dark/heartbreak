I started this project to express my feelings and put into action what I think could help me during heartbreak. Yeap, I've been heartbroken, seems silly to get heartbroken when it's someone you deeply love and care about but who doesn't see you in the same way. Hope this helps. I am trying to make an artsy website so its pretty difficult.
